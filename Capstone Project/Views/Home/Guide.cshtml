<h1>The 50/30/20 Rule Of Thumb For Budgeting</h1>










<span>
    <p>
        The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a way to allocate your budget according to three categories: needs, wants, and financial goals. It’s not a hard-and-fast rule but rather a rough guideline to help you build a financially sound budget.


        To better understand how to apply the rule, we’ll look at its background, how it works, and its limitations, plus go through an example. In other words, we’ll show you how and why to set up a budget using the 50/30/20 rule of thumb yourself.

        <strong>What Is the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb?</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
        The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a set of easy guidelines for how to plan your budget. Using them, you allocate your after-tax income to the following categories.

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>50% to Needs</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Needs are what you can’t live without, or at least very easily. They include things like:
        <ul>
            <li>Rent</li>
            <li>Groceries</li>
            <li>Utilities, such as electricity, water, and sewer</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>30% to Wants</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Wants are what you desire but don’t actually need to survive. They might include:
        <ul>
            <li>Hobbies</li>
            <li>Vacations</li>
            <li>Dining Out</li>
            <li>Digital and streaming services like Netflix and Hulu</li>
        </ul>

    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>20% to Financial Goals</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        This category covers two main areas:
        <ul>
            <li>All savings, such as retirement contributions, saving for a house, and setting money aside in a 529 college savings plan (note that contributions to a 401(k) come from your pre-tax income)</li>
            <li>Debt payments</li>
        </ul>
        Because this is just a guideline for planning your budget, you’ll need to supplement it with something to monitor spending, such as a budget tracker like YNAB (You Need a Budget), Mint, or Quicken. You can then set the 50/30/20 percentages as targets within whichever budget tracker you prefer.
    </p>

        <strong>Where Does the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb Come From?</strong>

    </p>
    <p>
        The 50/30/20 rule was popularized by Sen. Elizabeth Warren (a Harvard law professor when she coined the term) and her daughter, Amelia Warren Tyagi, in the book All Your Worth: The Ultimate Lifetime Money Plan.1﻿ It was designed as a rough rule of thumb for working-class families to plan their spending in order to prepare for the future and unforeseen circumstances.

        <strong>How to Use the 50/30/20 Rule of Thumb for Budgeting</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Most people save too little, and unknowingly spend too much. The 50/30/20 rule of thumb is a way to become aware of your financial habits and limit overspending and under-saving. By spending less on the things that don’t matter that much to you, you can save more for the things that do.

        Here’s how it works:
        <ol>
            <li>Calculate your monthly income: Add up how much you receive in your bank account each month. If you have a workplace retirement plan, find out how much is withheld and add that amount back in with your take-home pay. If you pay estimated taxes, reduce your monthly income amount accordingly.</li>
            <li>Calculate a spending threshold for each category: Multiply your take-home pay by 0.50 (for needs), 0.30 (for wants), and 0.20 (for financial goals) to see how much you should ideally spend in each category.</li>
            <li>Plan your budget around these numbers: Think of these three categories as “buckets” that you can fill with monthly expenses. List and tally your monthly expenses under the category each falls into and see if you’re spending less than the monthly targets you established in the prior step.</li>
            <li>Follow your budget: Track your expenses each month, and make changes where needed, in order to stick to your spending thresholds going forward.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
